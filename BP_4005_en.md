### Description

Text is much less bandwidth thrifty than multimedia formats such as audio or video even when it is formatted in HTML/CSS. Providing users with alternative textual content allows them to read instead of listening or watching, therefore saving much data. If textual alternatives are large-sized, you might not want to load them by default, but from users' initiative.

This also fulfills accessibility requirements: the hearing impaired can read content and therefore have access to it, as can the visually impaired, if text includes video descriptions elements that are only visually available.

This practice is also beneficial for SEO (Search Engine Optimization), as search engines can more easily analyze text than audio and video formats.

### Example

A 30-minute video typically takes up 500MB, a podcast of the same duration takes up 30MB, and an equivalent text is less than 1MB.
