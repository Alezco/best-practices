### Description

A circuit breaker interrupts requests processes across multiple services when one of the services isn't responding. Requests from user terminals can solicit useful services for which a degraded mode is acceptable. These are called non-critical. Depending on a certain number of error criterias (timeout, number of errors), the service that is calling a non-critical service can disable this call and immediately return an alternative response. This pattern avoids unnecessarily soliciting service and network.

### Example

On e-commerce websites, product sheet detailed information can be provided by dedicated services. The main service that retrieves product pages "learns" that the detailed information service encounters errors, thus avoiding unnecessarily calling it as long as it does not positively respond and therefore does not return the associated information to end users. The service remains operational even though experience is degraded.
