### Description

Application load is not constant over time in most cases. For example, there may be few or no users connected at night. In this case, it is not necessary to use such large technical infrastructures during off-peak hours as during high demand periods.

It is possible to dynamically and automatically modify infrastructure size based on the load, thanks to deployment mutualization (see rule #89 "Using virtualized servers"), particularly in the cloud. This modification can follow a schedule (for example, turning off applications only used during business hours at night) or can be done in response to the number of requests: when there is load increase, new virtual machines, application instances (containers, processes, or serverless functions, ...) are added and decommissioned when decreasing.

Tools like Docker can be used to create applications images that can be easily deployed or decommissioned by orchestration tools like Kubernetes. Cloud providers generally offer services to take advantage from these tools.

Testing and experimentation environments can notably be easily turned off at night and on non-working days.

Implementing an elastic architecture also creates costs savings as fewer server resources are used and billed for.

An elastic architecture has significant implementation costs in terms of workload and increased solution complexity. It is not essential to implement it if your application has low load or that the load is stable.
