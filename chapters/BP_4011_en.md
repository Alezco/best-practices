### Description
Reducing the volume of data stored to the bare minimum implies:
* optimizing large volumes of data management
* cleaning up old data, either by archiving them offline or deleting them
* ensuring that backups can be restored
* monitoring storage spaces size.
Legal constraints may require storing data that is never used over time, depending on the type of data, and their owners. Data use and imortance degree also impacts how it will be stored.

This method is part of the information lifecycle management framework.

### Example
* Define archiving processes: upon release, an annual report is stored on an SSD (hot zone). One month later, it will be archived on a classic storage system (cold zone). Finally, ten years later, it will be deleted.
* Avoiding duplicates between tables is a way to optimize stored data volume.
* Data use can lead to tables denormalization and therefore increasing storage space
