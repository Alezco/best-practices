### Description

It is possible to reduce servers power consumption by selecting energy-efficient equipment that provides similar service outcome.

### Example

Choose servers whose power supplies meet 80Plus eco-label (Platinum and Titanium levels) when purchasing them. Choose servers that are Energy Star certified.

It is also possible to choose hardware architecture that suits the web application type. For example, physicalization is more suitable for a high-traffic website: using "n" very low-power CPUs instead of "n" virtual machines running on a physical server whose processor (Xeon, etc.) is often energy-intensive.

### Validation rule

| The number of ...     | is equal to or less than   |  
|-------------------|:-------------------------:|
|  servers without an 80Plus Platinum or higher certified power supply OR not eco-labeled or Energy Star for server. | 0  |
