### Description

You should avoid allowing visitors to see everything by simply scrolling web pages and loading content little by little when displaying lists of products or articles on websites. This fancy effect will result in generating content as users scroll through their screens. This will therefore ask the associated server for the x next articles/products for each "scroll". This can lead to performance issues, SEO issues and accessibility issues.
Classic pagination system with an efficient filtering system should be implemented. Visitors will find content they are interested in more easily and so will indexing robots. This method facilitates compliance with French General Accessibility Improvement Repository (RGAA) introduced by law nÂ° 2005-102 of 02/11/05 for the equality of rights and chances, participation and citizenship of disabled people (cf. https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/rgaa-accessibilite/obligations/").
