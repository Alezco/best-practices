### Description

 Use the electricity source having the lowest environmental impact during its production as possible (e.g. hydraulic) to power digital equipment. Note that there is no solid way to ensure that the consumed electricity source has been produced with the lowest impact to this day.
As an alternative, you can either choose a provider that does not purchase any electricity produced from fossil fuels or buy EACs (Energy Attribute Certificate).

### Example

Although it only concerns greenhouse gas emissions, https://app.electricitymap.org/map allows you to be informed about carbon intensity depending on the supplier's country.
