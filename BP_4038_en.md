### Description

Websites' access path administration is often the same from one website to another when using renowned CMS. This is true for all sites using administration interfaces with classic access paths. "brute force" attacks are therefore very frequent as soon as "simple" URLs are found. These attacks have a very significant impact on networks and infrastructures.

Attacks are more likely to sucess when users identifiers tend to be common or when passwords are not strong enough.


### Example
WordPress, one of the most widely used CMS on the market, offers URL administration: /wp-admin or /wp-login.php Joomla offers /administrator. For Kirby, it is /panel, etc.

It is always possible to modify this address to limit attacks and improve website security. Replace administration pages URL with:

- random strings without uppercase letters: /ze62ane96, /o6_jhej639, /dj5zjaih2-ep8e
- one or more words related to your activity: /build, /play, /prepare-the-menu
- or combine both: /play_562fg6

Never use "admin", "domain name of the site", "first or last name of the company's manager" as identifiers. Strong passwords must contain at least 8 characters including: lowercase and uppercase letters, special characters and numbers. It is also possible to use CNIL password generator: [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-and-use-strong-passwords-c5cebb49-8c53-4f5e-2bc4-fe357ca048eb](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-and-use-strong-passwords-c5cebb49-8c53-4f5e-2bc4-fe357ca048eb)
