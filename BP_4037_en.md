### Description

Choosing the appropriate theme is crucial when using CMS. Themes add extensions and sometimes include page builders upon installation. Provided features are often far beyond users actual needs. Each extension adds its data, CSS and JS files, and the number of files stored on servers to the database to make it all work. Depending on development quality, additional assets can be heavy and/or redundant.

This causes:
- An increase in the number of requests
- An increase in page size
- An increase in processing time for internal requests
- An increase in content administration complexity


### Example

An all-in-one theme or one that includes a page builder can add features to put sliders in your articles, heavily personalizing your action buttons, or lets you integrate testimonials or create portfolios when you didn't plan on incorporating them into your content at all. Also, beware of incompatibilities caused by some of these extensions.

Choose simple themes providing essentials features. Then add features when they are really necessary.
